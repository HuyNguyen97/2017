    "To link the notion of events such as $E$ and collections of events, or *probability spaces* $\\Omega$ to data, we must introduce the concept of random variables. The following definition is taken from Larry Wasserman's All of Stats.\n",

    "$i = 1,...,M$, and $Y$, which takes the values ${y_j}$ where $j = 1,...,L$. The number of instances for which $X = x_i$ and $Y = y_j$ is $n_{ij}$. The number of points in column i where $X=x_i$ is $c_i$, and for the row where $Y = y_j$ is $r_j$.\n",

Then, we write the **conditional probability** of $Y = y_j$ given $X = x_i$ as $p(Y = y_j \\mid X = x_i)$. This is the asymptotic fraction of these instances where $Y = y_j$ and is obtained by dividing the instances in the cell by those in the comumn as \n",

    "$$ p(x,y) = p(x) \\, p(y) $$ \n",

    "$$ p(x,y|z) = p(x|z) p(y|z) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, if we learn about z, x and y become independent. Another way to write that $x$ and $y$ are conditionally independent of $z$ is \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ p(x| z, y) = p(x|z) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, if we condition on $z$, and now also learn about $y$, this is not going to change the probability of $x$. It is important to realize that conditional independence between $x$ and $y$ does not imply independence between $x$ and $y$. "
